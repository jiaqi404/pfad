# About Assignment \#2 
In this assignment, I visualized hourly predicted heights of tides in Kwai Chung in 2024. Data are from Hong Kong Observatory: https://www.hko.gov.hk/tide/KCTtextPH2024.htm.
I used 2 ways to visualize. Details are as below:

## Static graph of tide height
I have plotted the predicted wave heights over 24 hours for all days in January on a single figure, with each dayâ€™s curve being more transparent than the one for January 1st.
**Please run A2_DrawGraph.py to check.**

## Animation of tide height
Although the predicted wave heights for each day are stored separately, the data is essentially continuous. The wave height at 24:00 on January 1st is only one hour different from the wave height at 1:00 am on January 2nd. Therefore, I made an animation to continuously show the changes in wave heights in January.
