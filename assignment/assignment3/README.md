# About Assignment \#3
In this assignment, I used Streamlit to build a webpage that can get user's text input. Then I used a text to audio model to generate an audio clip based on the text description. I also used Librosa to generate a spectrogram for the generated music to give users a better understanding of the principles behind it. **Please run A3_TextToAudio.py to check.**
